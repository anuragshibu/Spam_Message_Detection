# Spam_Message_Detection

This project is a machine learning-based solution for detecting spam messages in text data. Spam messages, also known as unsolicited messages or junk messages, can be a nuisance and a security risk. The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately classify messages as either spam or not spam.

The dataset used for this project consists of a collection of text messages, labeled as either spam or not spam (ham). The data is split into a training set and a testing set to evaluate the model's performance.

I have used a machine learning model, such as a Naive Bayes classifier or it's variants to classify messages as spam or not spam because we know that Naive Bayes algorithm works best on textual data. The model is trained on the provided dataset and evaluated for its accuracy.

Thank you for using the Spam Message Detection project!
